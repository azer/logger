## Install

```bash
$ go get github.com/azer/logger
```

## Getting Started

Create an instance with a preferred name;

```go
import "github.com/azer/logger"

var log = logger.New("example-app")
```

Every logger has three methods: `Info`, `Timer` and `Error`.

```go
log.Info("Running at %d", 8080)

err := DoSomething()

if err != nil {
  log.Error("Failed: %s", err.Error())
}
```

Done. Now run your app, passing `LOG=*` environment variable. If you don't pass `LOG=*`, ([logging will be silent by default](http://www.linfo.org/rule_of_silence.html));

```
$ LOG=* go run example-app.go
01:23:21.251 example-app Running at 8080
```

You can filter logs by level, too. The hierarchy is; `mute`, `info`, `timer` and `error`.
After the package selector, you can optionally specify minimum log level:

```
$ LOG=*@timer go run example-app.go
01:23:21.251 example-app Running at 8080
```

The above example will only show `timer` and `error` levels. If you choose `error`, it'll show only error logs.

Check out [examples](https://github.com/azer/logger/tree/master/examples) for a more detailed example.

## Filters

You can enable all logs by specifying `*`:

```bash
$ LOG=* go run example-app.go
```

Or, choose specific packages that you want to see logs from:

```bash
$ LOG=images,users go run example-app.go
```

In the above example, you'll only see logs from `images` and `users` packages. What if we want to see only `timer` and `error` level logs?

```bash
$ LOG=images@timer,users go run example-app.go
```


Another example; show error logs from all packages, but hide logs from `database` package:

```bash
$ LOG=*@error,database@mute go run example-app.go
```

Another way to negate a package is to prefix it with "-". This is treated the same as package@mute:

```bash
$ LOG=*@error,-database go run example-app.go
```

## Timers

You can use timer logs for measuring your program. For example;

```go
timer := log.Timer()

image, err := PullImage("http://foo.com/bar.jpg")

timer.End("Fetched foo.com/bar.jpg")
```

Timer log lines will be outputting the elapsed time in time.Duration in a normal terminal, or in int64 format when your program is running on a non-terminal environment.
See below documentation for more info.

## Structured Output

When your app isn't running on a terminal, it'll change the output in JSON:

```
{ "time":"2014-10-04 11:44:22.418595705 -0700 PDT", "package":"database", "level":"INFO", "msg":"Connecting to mysql://azer@localhost:9900/foobar" }
{ "time":"2014-10-04 11:44:22.418600851 -0700 PDT", "package":"images", "level":"INFO", "msg":"Requesting an image at foo/bar.jpg" }
{ "time":"2014-10-04 11:44:22.668645527 -0700 PDT", "package":"images", "level":"TIMER", "elapsed":"250032416", "msg":"Fetched foo/bar.jpg" }
{ "time":"2014-10-04 11:44:22.668665527 -0700 PDT", "package":"database", "level":"ERROR", "msg":"Fatal connection error." }
```

So you can parse & process the output easily. Here is a command that lets you see the JSON output in your terminal;

```
LOG=* go run examples/simple.go 2>&1 | less
```

## Attributes

To add custom attributes to the structured output;

```go
log.Info("Sending an e-mail...", logger.Attrs{
  "from": "foo@bar.com",
  "to": "qux@corge.com",
})
```

The above log will appear in the structured output as:

```go
{ "time":"2014-10-04 11:44:22.919726985 -0700 PDT", "package":"mail", "level":"INFO", "msg":"Sending an e-mail", "from": "foo@foobar.com", "to": "qux@corge.com" }
```

In your command-line as:

## Programmatical Usage

Customizing the default behavior is easy. You can implement your own output;

```go
import (
  "github.com/azer/logger"
)

type CustomWriter struct {}

func (cw CustomWriter) Write (log *logger.Log) {
  fmt.Println("custom log -> ", log.Package, log.Level, log.Message, log.Attrs)
}

func main () {
  logger.Hook(&CustomWriter{})
}
```

See `examples/programmatical.go` for a working version of this example.
